                            <p class="text-left">1.  Users must note that all games available on the MPL platform are ‘Games of Skill’, under Indian law, and that MPL does not support, endorse or offer to Users ‘games of chance’ for money. While ‘Games of Skill’ do not have a comprehensive definition, they are those games where the impact of a player’s effort and skill on the outcome of a game is higher than the impact of luck and chance.</p>
                            <p class="text-left">2. The games hosted on the MPL platform have clearly defined rules and Users are encouraged to read, understand and follow these rules to be successful in these games.</p>
                            <p class="text-left">3. The games hosted on the MPL platform are ‘Games of Skills’, such that the outcome / success in the games is directly dependent on the User’s effort, performance and skill. By choosing how to play, the actions of Users shall have direct impact on the game.</p>
                            <p class="text-left">4.  Every game will have some elements of chance, but in the form of challenges / obstacles that a User would be able to overcome using his/her skills and knowledge of the game. Elements of luck are present in every game to add thrill and excitement, but no two attempts at a game are identical so Users must use their skills in order to be successful</p>
                            <p class="text-left">5. Since the games available on the MPL platform can be won through Users’ skills and such skills may be enhanced with practice and experience, the performance of a User may improve with time and practice.</p>
                            <p class="text-left">6. Different games will reward different skills, but each game will reward certain skills, such as knowledge of the game, familiarity with rules, experience, reflexes, experience, practice, hand-eye coordination etc.</p>
                            <p class="text-left">7. Certain games may have pre-determined outcomes (Sudoku, Crosswords, Brick Breaker), and these outcomes are achievable by Users using their skills.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">From day one, we built WhatsApp to help you stay in touch with friends, share vital information during natural disasters, reconnect with separated families, or seek a better life. Some of your most personal moments are shared with WhatsApp, which is why we built end-to-end encryption into our app. When end-to-end encrypted, your messages, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, and calls are secured from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
                            <p class="text-left">WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is available when you and the people you message use our app. Many messaging apps only encrypt messages between you and them, but WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption ensures only you and the person you're communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. This is because your messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipient and you have the special key needed to unlock and read them. For added protection, every message you send has its own unique lock and key. All of this happens automatically: no need to turn on settings or set up special secret chats to secure your messages.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-violet text-left">Speak Freely</h5>
                            <p class="text-left">WhatsApp Calling lets you talk to your friends and family, even if they're in another country. Just like your messages, WhatsApp calls are end-to-end encrypted so WhatsApp and third parties can't listen to them.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-violet text-left">Messages that Stay with You</h5>
                            <p class="text-left">Your messages should be in your hands. That's why WhatsApp doesn't store your messages on our servers once we deliver them, and end-to-end encryption means that WhatsApp and third parties can't read them anyway.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-violet text-left">See for Yourself</h5>
                            <p class="text-left">WhatsApp lets you check whether the calls you make and messages you send are end-to-end encrypted. Simply look for the indicator in contact info or group info.</p>
                            <h5 class="text-violet text-left">Get the Details</h5>
