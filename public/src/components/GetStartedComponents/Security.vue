        <p class="text-left">From day one, we built WhatsApp to help you stay in touch with friends, share vital information during natural disasters, reconnect with separated families, or seek a better life. Some of your most personal moments are shared with WhatsApp, which
            is why we built end-to-end encryption into our app. When end-to-end encrypted, your messages, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, and calls are secured from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
        <p class="text-left">WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is available when you and the people you message use our app. Many messaging apps only encrypt messages between you and them, but WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption ensures only you and the person you're communicating
            with can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. This is because your messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipient and you have the special key needed to unlock and read them. For added protection, every message
            you send has its own unique lock and key. All of this happens automatically: no need to turn on settings or set up special secret chats to secure your messages.</p>
        <h5 class="text-violet text-left">Speak Freely</h5>
        <p class="text-left">WhatsApp Calling lets you talk to your friends and family, even if they're in another country. Just like your messages, WhatsApp calls are end-to-end encrypted so WhatsApp and third parties can't listen to them.</p>
        <h5 class="text-violet text-left">Messages that Stay with You</h5>
        <p class="text-left">Your messages should be in your hands. That's why WhatsApp doesn't store your messages on our servers once we deliver them, and end-to-end encryption means that WhatsApp and third parties can't read them anyway.</p>
        <h5 class="text-violet text-left">See for Yourself</h5>
        <p class="text-left">WhatsApp lets you check whether the calls you make and messages you send are end-to-end encrypted. Simply look for the indicator in contact info or group info.</p>
